# virtual_screen_project
A real-time application that lets you draw, erase, and control a cursor on the screen using hand gestures detected from your webcam. Built with OpenCV and MediaPipe, this project transforms your index finger into a pen for writing, and your palm into an eraser â€” all without touching a mouse or touchscreen.
